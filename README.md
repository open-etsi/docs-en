GSM Data Generator GUI is a graphical interface for the [Data Generation](https://github.com/open-etsi/gsm-data-generator) library. It simplifies the creation and management of datasets for GSM, USIM, and eSIM applications. The tool provides an easy-to-use interface for developers and operators, bridging the gap between low-level telecom data generation and productivity-focused user workflows.

History and Acknowledgement
---------------------------
Data Generation started as a research project for USIM, ESIM etc.
<!-- The first version of the project benefited a lot from the following projects:

- [Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide): Part of TVM's TIR and arithmetic simplification module
 originates from Halide. We also learned and adapted some parts of the lowering pipeline from Halide.
- [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy): use of integer set analysis and its loop transformation primitives.
- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): the design inspiration of symbolic scan operator for recurrence. -->

Since then, the project has gone through several rounds of redesigns.
The current design is also drastically different from the initial design, following the
development trend of the community.
