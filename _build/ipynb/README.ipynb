    "GSM Data Generator GUI is a graphical interface for the [Data Generation](https://github.com/open-etsi/gsm-data-generator) library. It simplifies the creation and management of datasets for GSM, USIM, and eSIM applications. The tool provides an easy-to-use interface for developers and operators, bridging the gap between low-level telecom data generation and productivity-focused user workflows.\n",

    "Getting Started\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "Check out the [Data Generation Documentation]() site for installation instructions, tutorials, examples, and more.\n",
    "The [Getting Started with Data Generation]() tutorial is a great place to start.\n",
    "\n",

    "Features\n",
    "--------\n",
    "Synthetic GSM data generation, Operator-specific templates, data output in various formats, and GUI support.\n",

    "Contribute to Data Generation\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "Data Generation adopts the Apache committer model. We aim to create an open-source project maintained and owned by the community.\n",
    "Check out the [Contributor Guide]().\n",

    "History and Acknowledgement\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "Data Generation started as a research project for USIM, ESIM etc.\n",
    "<!-- The first version of the project benefited a lot from the following projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide): Part of TVM's TIR and arithmetic simplification module\n",
    " originates from Halide. We also learned and adapted some parts of the lowering pipeline from Halide.\n",
    "- [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy): use of integer set analysis and its loop transformation primitives.\n",
    "- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): the design inspiration of symbolic scan operator for recurrence. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, the project has gone through several rounds of redesigns.\n",
    "The current design is also drastically different from the initial design, following the\n",
    "development trend of the community."
