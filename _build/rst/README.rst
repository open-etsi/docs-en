 Open GSM Data Generation Stack
==============================

`Documentation <>`__ \| `Contributors <CONTRIBUTORS.md>`__ \|

GSM Data Generator GUI is a graphical interface for the `Data
Generation <https://github.com/open-etsi/gsm-data-generator>`__ library.
It simplifies the creation and management of datasets for GSM, USIM, and
eSIM applications. The tool provides an easy-to-use interface for
developers and operators, bridging the gap between low-level telecom
data generation and productivity-focused user workflows.
